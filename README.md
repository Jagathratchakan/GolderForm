**Project Overview - Sugarcane Stock Monitoring and Buying Android Application using Kotlin**

The Sugarcane Stock Monitoring and Buying Android Application is a mobile app designed to help sugarcane businesses manage their stock efficiently and allow customers to check product availability and prices. The app caters to two main user roles: Admin and User. The Admin has the authority to update raw material and stock details, while the User can access the app to check sugarcane prices and availability.

**Features:**

1. **Admin Panel:**
   - Secure login for Admin with authentication and authorization controls.
   - User-friendly dashboard for Admin to manage stock-related tasks.
   - Add, update, and delete raw material details, such as sugarcane varieties and supplier information.
   - Update stock details, including quantity, quality, and unit price.
   - View and analyze sales and purchase history to make informed decisions.
   - Set minimum stock levels to receive notifications for low stock situations.

2. **User Interface:**
   - User authentication for accessing sugarcane prices and availability.
   - Easy-to-use interface for searching sugarcane products and viewing their prices and stock availability.
   - Real-time updates on sugarcane stock to avoid out-of-stock situations.
   - Display product descriptions and specifications for better decision-making.

3. **Buying Options:**
   - Allow Users to add desired sugarcane products to their cart.
   - Calculate the total cost of selected sugarcane products in the cart.
   - Provide a seamless checkout process for Users to place orders securely.
   - Integrate payment gateways for secure online transactions.

4. **Stock Notifications:**
   - Notify the Admin when sugarcane stock levels reach the minimum threshold for specific products.
   - Send in-app notifications to Admin regarding low stock situations.
   - Notify Users if a sugarcane product they wish to buy is out of stock.

5. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Implement data synchronization mechanisms to ensure Admin and Users have access to real-time data.
   - Enable offline access to some app features for Users in areas with limited internet connectivity.
   - Synchronize data with the server once the device reconnects to the internet.

6. **Security and Data Protection:**
   - Implement secure user authentication using JWT for both Admin and Users.
   - Encrypt sensitive data and ensure secure data storage on the server.

**Technology Stack:**
- Kotlin: As the primary programming language for Android app development.
- Android Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development.
- Firebase: For backend services such as Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Messaging.
- Retrofit: For handling API requests and data retrieval from the server.
- Payment Gateway Integration: Utilizing a trusted payment gateway provider for secure transactions.

**Project Structure:**
1. `app/`: Contains all Kotlin code and resources for the Android app.
2. `src/`: Includes all Java/Kotlin source files and resource files.
3. `res/`: Holds all resource files, such as layouts, drawables, and values.
4. `models/`: Includes data models and classes for handling data representation.
5. `utils/`: Contains utility classes and functions.
7. `auth/`: Includes classes for user authentication and authorization.
8. `database/`: Contains classes for handling data storage and retrieval from Firebase Realtime Database.
9. `ui/`: Contains all Activity and Fragment classes for the app's user interface.

**Expected Outcome:**
The Sugarcane Stock Monitoring and Buying Android Application will provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for sugarcane businesses and customers. The app's Admin Panel will enable efficient stock management, while Users can easily check sugarcane prices and availability before making purchases. With real-time data synchronization, secure authentication, and robust features, the app will streamline the stock management process and enhance the buying experience for customers.
